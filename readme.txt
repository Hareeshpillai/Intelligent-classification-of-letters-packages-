Project title: Classification of letters & packages system

Description: 
Classification of letters & packages system is to classify the letters and packages by more efficient way. We change the ZIP code numbers into the barcode, 
so that we can scan it instead of watching the numbers. It can save not only the time, but also the human resources. The system is designed by Python.

Team members:
We are team 9, our group memebers are as follows:

Instructor: Dr. Hareesh, National Tsing Hua University.

The project is organized in the following folders:

1. Ideation 
Our idea is changing the ZIP code numbers into barcode. Just by scanning the code and go through the program we designed, the classification can be done easily.

2. Uml design
UML design make our project more clearly, and can let us programming steps by steps. Also, it can help us to find out where the problem is. 

3. Final project presentation
Our team use Python to write the final project. Cause we need a scanner to read the barcode, and we found an APP that can use the computer camera to scan. It
can only connect with Python. So we choose Python to progamming.

4. Demonstration video
The video shows how to operate the system.

5. Code
We use Python3.7 in our project, 
show the barcode to camera, and it will turn it into ZIP code numbers, then it will check the first digit of ZIP code to decide where the letter should be.
Second, it will check the next 2 digit of ZIP code to decide more detailed place of the letter.

6. Bugs and future improvements
There are total 5 digit in ZIP code number, but currently we only check the first 3 digit of it. So about the future improvement, we hope to use the last 2 
digit to classify the letters more accurate.
